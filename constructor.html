       // As illustrated previously, constructor is a property that lets you figure out which constructor
        //function was used to create the object:

        ({}).constructor === Object; // true
        ({}).constructor === Array; // false

        //Since only one specific constructor was used to create the object, you cannot use the
        //constructor property to look up the inheritance chain the way you’d do with isProto
          //  typeOf():

        ([]).constructor === Array; // true
        ([]).constructor === Object; // false
