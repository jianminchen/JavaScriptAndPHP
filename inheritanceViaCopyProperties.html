        /*

        Since inheritance is all about reusing code, another way to implement it is to simply
copy over properties from one object to another.
Imagine you have these objects:

        */

        var shiny = {
            shiny: true,
            round: true
        };
        var normal = {
            name: 'name me',
            getName: function () {
                return this.name;
            }
        };


        /*

        How can shiny get the properties of normal? Here’s a simple extend() function that
loops through and copies properties:

        */

        function extend(parent, child) {
            for (var i in parent) {
                if (parent.hasOwnProperty(i)) {
                    child[i] = parent[i];
                }
            }
        }

        extend(normal, shiny); // Inherit

        shiny.getName(); // "name me"

        /*
            Copying properties may look like overhead and something that can hurt performance,
but for many tasks it’s just fine. You can also see that this is an easy way to implement
mixins and multiple inheritance.
