        Let’s wrap up with yet another way to implement inheritance, which is probably the
closest to PHP because it looks like a constructor function inheriting from another
constructor function; hence, it looks a bit like a class inheriting from a class.
Here’s the gist:

        */

        function extend(Child, Parent) {
            var F = function () { };
            F.prototype = Parent.prototype;
            Child.prototype = new F();
        }

        /*
        With this method, you pass two constructor functions to extend(). After extend() is
done, any new objects created with the first constructor (the child) get all the properties
and methods of the second (the parent) via the prototype property.

        */

        /*
        This method is often referred to as “classical” in quotes because it looks
the closest to the idea of classes.

        */

        /*

        There are only two small things to add to extend():
1. Have the child keep a reference to the parent, just in case.
2. Reset the constructor property of the child to point to the child’s constructor, in
case this is needed for introspection (you’ll see some more about this property in
Chapter 5):
        */
        function extend(Child, Parent) {
            var F = function () { };
            F.prototype = Parent.prototype;
            Child.prototype = new F();
            Child.prototype.parent = Parent;   // have the child keep a reference to the parent
            Child.prototype.constructor = Child;  // reset the constructor property of the child to point to the child's constructor
        }

        function Parent() {
            this.name = "Papa";
        }

        Parent.prototype.family = "Bear";
        function Child() { }
        extend(Child, Parent);

        /*
        The property name is not inherited, but the family is:
        */
        new Child().name; // undefined
        new Child().family; // "Bear"

        /*
        And the child has access to the parent:
        */
        Child.prototype.parent === Parent; // true
